    Using Magneto as main clock, batumi and Tides as divider.
    My main source was Rubicon with Dixie as an FM modulator.
    I then used Plonk for additional texture.
    I should have try pushing the system in audio rate by speeding the Magneto Clock.
    Using the Sub of the Rubicon modulated in amplitude by a division of Batumi allows for nice timbre.
    Next I should play with generating signal burst by modulating divisions of Batumi &/|| Tides.

    I tried to add voice to my new "everything live with a modular so you don't have to look back" workflow.
    Obviously needs a lot more work, my brain is struggling to handle voice/tweak knobs/input new notes/make the three coherent.
    It's really fun thought, and it's been a while since I have not organize a little text with all my notebook thought.
    On the modular side, the bass is a Maths voice, gate on cycle to start oscillation, channel 1 to channel 2 for filtering. 
    The pad is Tides in divide shift mode.
    Some LFO are synced using the keystep drum gates.

    I have rework the helper.py file of the VCV SDK so I can use the part that scan SVG more easily.
    I still haven't understand some of the behaviour of python regarding the renaming of fonction, maybe I will find enlightement someday.
    Still have to tweak the script a little bit so it can add the position to the already created .cpp file, also some bug to fix as always.
    The fact that I had to do this makes me question the way that I design modules. Should I start writing code only when I have my panel ready ?
    It seems strange to me that you can develop a concept without playing with it. Still, I should try this workflow someday.
