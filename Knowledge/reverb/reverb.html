            <span class="caps">A</span>ll discoveries, and even mistakes (especially mistakes) can be new points of

        <p><span class="caps">R</span>everberation is a highly complex phenomenon that cannot be modelled in real time
            with today's equipment, and even less so with the technology available at the time of the first

            Researchers therefore decided to limit themselves to a <i>perceptive</i> simulation of reverberation,

        <h2 id="time&freq">Time and frequency density</h2>
        The two crucial points in the design of a reverberation are :
        <ul>
            <li>Frequency density <span class="math">Df</span>, defined by the number of modes per Hz</li>
            <li>Time Density <span class="math">Dt</span>, defined by the number of echoes per second</li>
        </ul>
        After studying impulse responses, Schroeder suggests :
        <ul>
            <li><span class="math">Df = 0.15 modes/Hz </span></li>
            <li><span class="math">Dt = 1000 echos/seconds</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <span class="math">Df</span> being proportional to the reverberation time, 0.15 is the value for a 1 second

            </span>.
            <br><span class="math">Dt</span> is proportional to the sample rate, which was very low at the time,
            it would be around 10k echos/s at
            44.1 kHz.
            <br><br>
            From a perceptive point of view, too low a density will give a sensation of flutter (characteristic of small
            rooms with parallel walls).<br>
            We're looking for the flattest possible frequency response, especially in the reverberation tail, which
            researchers consider to be exponentially decreasing white noise.
        </p>
        <h2 id="comb">Comb filter</h2>
        <p>
            Early reverberation simulations used an analog delay line (magnetic tape) to generate an echo. The output of
            this echo could then be fed back to the input to generate successive, exponentially decreasing echoes.
            <br>This naïve method is fraught with problems, one of which led to one of the first papers on algorithmic
            reverberation design. Indeed, M. R. Schroeder noticed that for short delays, approaching a reverberation
            effect, the timbre of the source was strongly altered.
            <br>Summing a signal with its delayed version, as one does with a delay line in a feedback loop, gives a
            comb filtering effect.

            This filter, with its characteristic comb-shaped frequency response, produces a sound perceived as
            “metallic”.
            In order to increase time and frequency density, we need to use several delay units, of which there are two
            possibilities
        <ul>
            <li>
                Paralleling, which multiplies <span class="math">Dt</span>, but requires a very large number of units to
                achieve the suggested constraints (impossible with the technical means of the time)
            </li>
            <li>
                Serial connection, which exponentiates <span class="math">Dt</span>, but greatly deteriorates the signal
                since the distortions of all the filters are superimposed.
                It is possible to limit the number of filters by reducing delay times, at the cost of a deterioration in
                timbre.
            </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2 id="allpass">All-pass filter</h2>
        <p>
            Schroeder sought to design a new reverberation unit that would meet 6 constraints:
        <ol>
            <li>Frequency response must be flat</li>
            <li>Reverberator modes must cover the entire audio spectrum</li>
            <li>The decay times of the individual modes should be close or equal, so that the different frequency
                components decay at the same rate.</li>
            <li>The transient response must be dense enough not to generate audible echoes.</li>
            <li>Reverberation should not suggest temporal periodicity</li>
            <li>Reverberation should not imply amplitude-frequency periodicity (as does the comb filter).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            He then proposes a filter to validate points 1, 3 and 6.
            By adding the delayed signal with a gain inverse to the feedback gain, we effectively obtain a filter with a
            flat frequency response: the all-pass filter.

            To validate the remaining points, it is once again necessary to use several units of this delay. Thanks to
            the properties of this new filter, we can now use them in series (and thus exponentiate the number of
            echoes), and thus achieve the recommended density values.
            These series of scatterers will form the basis of subsequent algorithms.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Schroeder">Schroeder topology</h2>
        <p>
            This results in a much more convincing reverberation tail, and makes it possible to add practical tools for
            sound engineers: pre-delay and Dry/Wet mix (ratio of direct sound to reverberated sound, often in
            percentages).
            <br>For pre-delay, simply add a delay line before reaching the reverberation. For Dry/Wet, you need
            to be careful not to violate the principles established with the all-pass filter, by adding the necessary
            gains to avoid falling back into comb filtering.
            <br>In many cases, the human ear can't tell the difference between a flat response and a sufficiently dense,
            irregular response. In reality, room reverberation has an average fluctuation of 10dB and around 15 modes
            per 100 Hz (<span class="math">0.15 modes/Hz</span>).
            Schroeder therefore uses 4 comb filters in parallel, generating <span class="math">4 modes/Herz</span>, but
            only a hundred or so echoes per seconds.
            <br>He thus add 2 all-pass filters in series to get closer to the target of <span class="math">1000
                echos/seconds</span>.

            This topology makes it possible to simulate a wider variety of rooms and better tailor the reverberation
            tail to our needs.
        </p>
        <h2 id="highfreq"> High Frequency absorption </h2>
        <p>
            The path of sound through the air attenuates high frequencies, and this effect is far from negligible.
            Moorer
            gives the example of the Boston Symphony Hall:
            A 1.7s reverberation implies 600m of distance traveled, which would mean (for 40% humidity), that a 4kHz
            signal
            would be attenuated by 60dB more than a 1kHz signal, which shows the importance of this parameter in the
            reverberation tail.
            <br>In order to simulate the attenuation caused by the air, we can add a high-cut filter to the feedback
            loop. It's
            important to consider its stability given its context, so we prefer to use a finite impulse response filter
            to
            limit the risks. This type of filter is sufficient to simulate the desired effect.
        </p>
        <h2 id="early">Early reflections</h2>
        <p>
            Early reflections remain one of the main areas for improvement.
            Unlike the reverberation tail, whose statistical description is largely defined by the volume of the room,
            early reflections are a series of discrete echoes, strongly dependent on the source/listener position.
            These first 80 milliseconds contain the information that enables our perception to characterize the acoustic
            space represented by the reverberation.
            But an exact simulation of this phenomenon can quickly become very computationally intensive, and therefore
            unthinkable for real time (at least at the time).
            One proposal is to split the reverberation into two, with an FIR filter for the first reflections, made up
            of a series of delays, followed by reverberators based on the schematics seen previously. To link these two
            systems, Moorer adds a reverberator to diffuse these first reflections, with a delay ideally equal to the
            last delay in the series, so that it starts at the end of the first reflections.
            This sequence of delays can be modeled on analyses of a real room for greater realism. Moorer recommends a
            minimum section of 7 delays.

        <h2 id="moorer">Moorer topology</h2>
        <p>
            Moorer refined Schoeder's topology by adding early reflections and treble absorption, as well as refining
            the parameters already present.
            He gives the following guidelines for reproducing his work:
        <ul>
            <li>The recursive part should consist of 6 parallel comb filters, each containing a first-order low-pass
                filter in the loop.</li>
            <li>Delays should be linearly distributed with a ratio of 1:1.5, the shortest delay being around 50
                milliseconds.</li>
            <li>The outputs of the six comb filters should be summed into an all-pass filter network with a gain of 0.7
                and a delay of about 6 milliseconds.</li>
            <li>Delay times in samples should be as close to prime numbers as possible, to avoid multiple delays looping
                on the same samples, creating audible peaks. (For high feedback values, sensitivity to exact size
                becomes negligible).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 id="modulation"> Modulation of delay lines</h2>
        <p>
            To break the repetition patterns in reverberation tanks, the delay times of the delay lines need to change
            over time.
            To achieve a transparent effect, it is necessary to generate a slow, subtle movement, which requires the
            calculation of interstitial samples. As the data vectors are discrete, what do we do when the modulation
            asks for sample 1.5?
            This technique requires an interpolation algorithm.
            This algorithm needs to be as efficient as possible in terms of computing resources, as it will be
            multiplied by the number of delay lines, and is only a secondary system in the operation of the
            reverberation.

            <span class="math">i.frac</span> the index (decimal part <span class="math">.frac</span>) of the sample to
            be accessed.
            <br>In practice, we have a low-pass filter with a variable coefficient
            <br><br>
            Linear interpolation therefore has several disadvantages:
        <ol>
            <li>Amplitude distortion: low-pass filtering process with a dynamic zero at the Nyquist-Shannon frequency.
            </li>
            <li>Amplitude modulation: modification of filter coefficients introduces audible flutter.</li>
            <li>Phase distortion: because each filter has non-constant delays</li>
            <li>aliasing: an upward pitch corresponds to a reduction in sampling frequency.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        We can try to limit amplitude distortion by using all-pass interpolation
        </p>

        <span class="equation">
            <td>O[n] = Buf[i + 1] + Buf[i] * (1 - frac) - O[n-1] * (1 - frac)</td>
        </span>
    </p>
        <p>
            A recursion weighted by an opposite gain is added.
            However, this technique has one major drawback:
            the exact <span class="math">frac</span> value is followed less precisely.
            This results in greater distortion, limiting this polyphasic filter to micro-tone changes (+/- 1 semitone).
            We can limit this distortion in certain frequency bands by warping the parameter values, replacing <span
                class="math">1 - frac</span> by <span class="math">(1 - frac) / (1 + frac)</span>.

        <!-- <p> -->
            To generate larger pitch changes while maintaining correct signal quality, the simplest solution is to
            return to linear interpolation, having first performed a significant amount of up-sampling on the signal.
        </p>

        <h3 id="signals">Modulation Signals</h3>
        <p>
            Delay line Modulation produce a pitch modulation artifact, in the way of a tape being slowed down or sped
            up.
            Ideally, modulation signals must be decorelated to avoid a global pitch movement, giving a "seasick"
            sensation in the reverberation tail.
            Altought strong modulation can be welcome in some effect-type reverb.
            In some early reverberation, numeric signal where used for modulation, but their low resolution (8 bit) can
            create audible artifacts.
            It may be considered as a part of the character of the unit, but it shows that modulation signals are an
            integral part of the overall sound of the reverberation and shouldn't be overlooked.

        <h2 id="griesinger">Griesinger Topology</h2>
        <p>
            This topology, which can be found in Jon Dattorro's papers, is a Lexicon algorithm used to reproduce the
            impulse response of a reverberation plate.

            This mesh is composed of the elements seen above,
        <ul>
            <li>Delays : Z<sup>-n</sup> blocks.</li>
            <li>All-pass filters : with the two sums and a feedforward / feedback.</li>
            <li>low-pass filters : little feedback loop with one sample delay and two coefficient (effectively doing an
                averaging between the actual and the previous sample)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The signal is first diffused through the 4 all-pass filters at the top (in series), then sent to the
        reverberation tanks, which recirculate the signal and significantly increase the total reverberation time.
        We can see that reverberation tanks have much larger delay lines than the first all-pass filters.
        The reservoirs also contain filters to simulate treble absorption.
        The output of this reverberation is a weighted sum of all the sampling points indicated by numbers along the
        path.

        <h2 id="ring">Allpass Ring</h2>
        <p>
            There's not much information available on allpass rings, although it seems to be quite common in commercial
            reverbs. You can find traces of it on a <a href="http://www.spinsemi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3">forum
                about signal processing.</a>
            This topology consists of a long series of looped all-pass filters with several input and output points.
        </p>

        <h2 id="fdn">Feedback Delay Network</h2>
        <p>
            To simplify the study of recursion networks, Jot proposes to define a parallelization of filters whose
            recursion gains would be managed by a matrix distributing the signals over several filters.
            <!-- </p> -->
        <figure>

        <p>
            In this one-output, one-input diagram, the coefficient matrix can be seen at top right. On each recursion
            path there is a delay line and a high-cut filter for high-frequency absorption.
            Jot draws the following conclusions from his observations :
        <ul>
            <li>system stability is guaranteed in the case where the feedback matrix is the product of a unitary matrix
                and a diagonal matrix whose elements have a magnitude less than 1.</li>
            <li>Choosing a unitary feedback matrix forces all the system's poles to lie on the unit circle, so the
                system has only non-decreasing modes.</li>
            <li>If the matrix is diagonal, we return to the case of parallel comb filters.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 id="modern">Modern Evolution</h2>
        <p>
            Engineers continue to develop new techniques: Sean Costello, the person behind Valhalla DSP, uses a system that
            borrows from both the all-pass series and FDN, making FDN's recursion paths more complex by replacing the
            usual delay unit with 3 all-pass filters.
