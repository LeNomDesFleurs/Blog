                <a href = /./../Knowledge.html>  &#8592; Note Taking</a>
        </div>    
</header>


<div><p>
    I stumble more and more on the note taking question, deep implication :
    <ul>
        <li>How to externalize Memory</li>
        <li>What to memorize</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Those are lifetime question, never quite answered, always reflectiong on the matter, learning what you want to learn.
        <br> Here I'll talk about the different tools I used, namely : OneNote, Google keep, Notion, Obsidian (more broadly .md files), notebooks.
        <br>My need are probably not the same as everyone, my bias are :
        <ul>
            <li>I do not need file syncing, using less and less my phone and working primerly on my computer.</li>
            <li>I want it perrenial (local file, universal file type)</li>
            <li>Dead Simple, no stuff that'll eat your time making your note fancy</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OneNote</h3>
    <p>I used OneNote from Microsft (boohing) for some time (4/5 years), it's the tool my father use, But it's not my cup of tea.<br>
    The spacial way of organizing stuff is really intersting, especially for writing papers, comping data from multiple pdf and notes.
    <br>But it is quite heavy, your file are stored on your one drive (which is sometimes hard to find).<br>
    It require a Microsft account.
    <br>The folder system is rather strange: virtual notebook contain tab that contain pages, typical skeumorphism that doesn't make much sense nowadays.<br>
    Also the toolbar is a bit bloated, equation are not easy to use.
</p>
    
    <h3>Google Keep</h3>
    <p>
        Have used it for few month, I like the colors and the way note are displayed.<br>
        I'm still using it on my phone, mainly because I think I uninstalled the default note app and I cannot find it back.<br>
        It's very simple, has tag, can be accessed on my computer.
    </p>
    <h3>Notion</h3>
    <p>
        Notion is a wonderful tool, nice color selection, I love it's UI, you can embed wathever you want in the page by a drag and drop, etc...<br>
        <strong><em>but</em></strong><br>
        In a way it's exacly what I <em>don't</em> want, so close yet so far.<br>
        Now way of truly offline syncing file, everything is stored on their server, 
        <br>The app is really laggy, and I'm not to fond of browser app in general.<br>
        <br>They have their own file format and exporting form notion to obsidian has been a pain in the ass.<br>
        I mean, don't get me wrong, it took maybe 2 hours, but only because a nice person had made a renaming script beforehand, and even then, it should be way more easier.
    </p>
    <h3>Obsidian (MarkDown)</h3>
    <p>
        Markdown file is probably the way to go for long lasting notes, there seems to be an infinite ressource of markdown editor.<br>
        I like Obsidian because of the way it display Markdown, all symbols are hidden and appear when the cursor goes above it for editing.<br>
        It doesn't need the dual preview pane that is usual in markdown.<br>
        Graph view, I gotta say I don't really use it.<br>
        There's not much color (also it can be added with plugin), but perfect integration of picture, latex equation, it can contain pdf in it's folder and split pane with a note.<br>
        It's quite versatile, mine is stored on my computer and backed up in a cloud.
    </p>
    <h3>NoteBook</h3>
    <p>
        Been using notebook for a long time, but scarcely, for some poem / lyrics and thought<br>
        I now use them a lot more, mostly to develop my project idea, as a reflection support.<br>
        Use a sprinkle of bullet journaling, At the end of the notebook I keep all the utility stuff : index, to-do, calendar.<br>
        I made some symbols so I quicly know what a page is about, I use color-coded post-it to mark the pages I may want to come back to.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Blog</h3>
    <p>
        The blog has a particular status in all of this, it's made to readable by someone else, there is a kind of "quality standard".<br>
        It's an interesting place to develop idea, writing a bit more in depth than I would in other mediums.<br>
        It's also a place where I store methodology, how I did something. Thinking it for someone I don't know ensure that a future me would be able to understand.<br>
        A blog also give a form of finality, for exemple, this very page gives me a sense of "ok, this idea has been researched, my brain can go search stuff elsewhere".<br>
        
    </p>
    <h3 style="color:darkolivegreen">What do I really want to remember / actual use of these tools</h3>
    <p>
        Depending on the information, I don't use the same tool, it really comes down to how and if I really want to remember it.<br>
        It's mostly a question of feeling, for me markdown as this kind of "always present" feeling, when notebook give you the opportunity to forget, maybe revisit this space later.
        <br>I think it's because file can always be rewrote, reorganized. Notebooks are fixed, ink is dry and now it's read-only.
        <br><br>As a tl;dr :<ul>
        <li>Markdown is mainly for big projects that imply a lot of writing</li>
        <li>Notebook for any kind of notes, definition, on-going reflection, learning about stuff, ...</li>
        <li>Google keep for on the go note</li>
        <li>HTML to crystallize knowledge and keep an archive of stuff I made and how I made it </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Also I always have an apple stickies open on my laptop for quick to do or cliping text (There is no native clipboard history on macos)</p>
