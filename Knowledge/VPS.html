                <h1> VPS</h1>
            </a>
        </div>

    A VPS is a virtual machine hosted on a server, it's very cheap (as of now, mine cost 1$ / month for 2go of RAM and
    20go of storage).<br>
    It allows me to store more data than github and can do processing, I may now (god forgive me for what I'm about to
    say) make dynamic webpage !<br>
    All of this came from the fact that I wanted to make a guest book, which needed php or a kind of processing that
    coudn't be static (although you may ask people to send you mail and post it after, such as this <a
        href=https://azlen.me/doorstep> lovely website shoerack</a>).<br>
    There will probably be a page on php soon.<br><br>
    Doing the setup of a server has been easier than I thought, taking a day from no vps to functional website with no
    previous knowledge of server managment.
    I chose a debian 10 distrib, I never used linux and thought trying debian would be fun (it is).<br>
    It's not really an informed desicion, I think I heard somewhere that a lot of server runned on debian, after a bit
    of research it seems it is one of the most popular with ubuntu server.<br>
    So here I go, sshing into my faraway server for the first time !
    <br><br>
    For a server to serve a website, there is some stuff you gotta take care of
    <ul>
        <li>Be able to manage HTTP request - <b>Apache / Nginx</b></li>
        <li>Be able to compute dynamic processing - <b>PHP & fastCGI</b> </li>
        <li>Be able to serve HTTPS - <b>Cerbot</b></li>
        <li>Link your IP to the URL - <b>DNS</b></li>

    </ul>

    This stack of software is know as LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP), there is a lot of variant. Here I'm using LEMP
    (Linux Nginx MySQL PHP).<br>
    Also I don't use SQL because I don't have any data to store on my website.
    <br>
    <h3>NGINX</h3>
    Debian is preinstalled when I connect to the server, the first step is to install nginx, for this you'll use the
    package manager of debian : APT (Advanced Package Manager).<br>
    You'll find tutorial that use <code>apt</code>, other that use <code>apt-get</code>, both share some commands,
    <code>apt-get</code> is more backward compatibity oriented, <code>apt</code> is more fancy, with added search
    fonctionality for exemple.<br>
    Just to be safe, you should probably update the package manager beforehand
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo apt update
    </div>
    And then install nginx
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo apt install nginx
    </div>
    You can then check if nginx is running
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo service nginx status
    </div>
    <br>
    If nginx is correctly running, you should see some nginx default html file when typing your vps adress in your
    browser search bar.<br><br>

    You will find the configuration stuff under <br><code>/etc/nginx/</code><br>
    Most of the usefull stuff will be in this file <br><code>/sites-available/default</code><br>
    In it you will find the port you are lisening to and the root folder of your website :
    <code>/var/www/html/</code>

    <br><br>
    Now you may clone your website repo to this place !<br>
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo apt install git<br>
        cd /var/www/html<br>
        git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME.git
    </div>
    To copy all the content out of the dir (which is probably not the cleanest way of doing it), I used
    <div class="code-container">
        cp -a /source/. /dest/<br>
    </div>
    Then, delete the directory<br>
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo rm -r source
    </div>

    <h3>HTTPS</h3>
    Your website may not load correctly on all browser if it can't serve https, the encrypted big brother of http.<br>
    To serve https you need an SSL certificate, when connecting to the server, your browser check the certificate and
    handshake to start the encrypted connection if everything is ok.<br>
    Certificates are delivered by Certificate Authority, some cost money, some are free.<br>
    We'll use Let's Encrypt through Certbot, Let's Encrypt is free but need to be renewed every 2 months.<br>
    <br>
    To install certbot we'll need another package manager : snap <br>
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo apt install snapd <br>
        sudo snap install core
    </div>
    Once it is done you can install certbot with
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
sudo certbot --nginx
</pre>
    </div>
    The last command will automatically edit your nginx config file to use https.


    <h3>PHP</h3>
    FastCGI is a protocol for interfacing program with a web server.<br>
    php-fpm is a wrapper of php for fastCGI, it runs php as a separate server, nginx sends query to the php server when
    needed.
    <br>First, install the php-fpm package (in my case it's 8.2 but it may vary).<br>

    <div class="code-container">
        sudo apt install php8.2-fpm
    </div>

    verify if the service is running
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo service php8.2-fpm status
    </div>
    if not, use
    <div class="code-container">
        service php8.2-fpm start
    </div>
    To connect php-fpm to nginx, edit the nginx config file to add index and uncomment the location
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    root /var/www/html;
    index <stan style="color: white;">index.php</stan> index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

    server_name your_server_ip;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
    <stan style="color:white">
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php8.2-fpm.sock;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }</stan>
}
</pre>
    </div>
    Remember to change the php version version depending on yours !!<br>
    Test for syntax error
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo nginx -t
    </div>
    then reload nginx
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo systemctl reload nginx
    </div>
    <br>

    <h3>Changing permission if PHP can't write</h3>
    Create a PHP file containing the following:
    <div class="code-container"><pre>
        &lt;?php echo `whoami`; ?&gt;
        </pre>
    </div>
    Upload it to your web server. The output should be similar to the following:
    <br>
    www-data
    <br>
    Therefore, the PHP user is www-data.
    <br><br>
    By using <code>ls -dl</code>, you can see the permission and owners of the directory you are in, example at root
    <div class="code-container"><pre>
        debian@vps-d1a0526b:~$ ls -dl<br>
        drwxr-xr-x 7 debian debian 4096 Dec 9 12:59 .
    </pre>
    </div>

    You can add this user to the owners of a directory by using
    <div class="code-container">
        sudo chown -R www-data directory
    </div>

    You can reuse ls -dl to check if www-data has been correctly added to the owners.


    <h3>URL</h3>
    The last step is to link the IP of your server to a url to make it easily accessible, the method will vary depending
    on your domain provider.


    <h3>File transfer</h3>
    To transfer file from your computer to your server you are suppose to use some kind of file transfer protocol such
    as SFTP.<br>
    I'm lazy so I use visual studio code to drag and drop stuff in the explorer.
