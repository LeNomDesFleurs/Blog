    Finally took a VPS (OVHcloud), and migrated my website to it !
    You can read all the stuff I learned on setuping a VPS on <a href="Knowledge/VPS.html"> this knowledge page</a>.<br>
    The next step is probably to have my own server, we'll see how things goes.
    <br>I also learned how to <a href="Knowledge/PHP.html">setup a php test environment</a> and made a little
    <a href="GuestBook/guestbook.php">guestbook</a> whose working is explained on <a href="Projects/guestbook.html">this

    I wrote lyrics without to much thinking, it's often the moment everything slows down and I keep getting stucked.
    So these time I just took words that rhyme and made phrases around them, was fun.<br>
    The first one is heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daKqLm-l6GA">Souvent Parfois of
        UTO</a>.
    The second one is really weird tho', in a quirky kind of way.<br>
    Still an heavy use of compression everywhere.<br>
    Using more and more the polybrute, learning to use the morphing in interesting manner, for exemple, even if a
    parameter doesn't change the sound of preset A, it might create new movement while morphing to preset B.<br>
    Lots of things to try.

    Recently I've read the house of leaves, cannot recommend it enough.<br> It's rare to read something that is that
    free in form, yet approchable, it does count a story in a original manner but you don't need a cork bulletin board
    to decipher the meaning.

    I have a fond memory of my time working with tape. I was using a tascam BR-20 and this kind of reel-to-reel cannot
    overdub (no tape can, at least in conventional usage). You have a rec button for channel 1 and a rec button for
    channel 2, each time you record, you erase the sound. Using small tape loop, this workflow creates tracks with
    choppy sampling and inserted silence. You can also vary the tape speed at recording and playing, multiple texture
    with different repitching colide with each others. I recreated this workflow on ableton and made new tracks, I'll
    maybe try and make an ep with a dozen of those.
    <br>Here are a couple of examples, with the loop played 3 times to give a sense of pattern.
    <br> Most sounds comes from me singing / blowing at my laptop microphone and from the arturia polybrute.

    Recently, I remembered an old thought : When I started to learn more and more about sound and all of its
    ramification, it opened a window on the complexity of each thing, guessing how the roots of a tree looks based on
    your experience with an other tree.
    Learning about a subject gives substance to world.

    These time I'm spending a lot of time on my master thesis, I'll probably post more when my tought are ripe, it's
    about graphical interpolation system and audio plugin.

    I enjoy experimentating with my module (especially the pruners prototype), don't really know what to keep and what
    to discard from this prototype, awesome sounds but very unpredictable.<br>

    I chose to delete some online data :
    I deleted all google history, which include maps, youtube, etc... <br>
    Youtube has been consuming a <i>lot</i> of time those last years, quitting has been hard because I also found a lot
    of interesting stuff on the platform, but at a certain point it was just more bad than good. I'm still watching some
    videos with my girlfriend, but now it's almost some kind of "film" it has it's own dedicated time zone.<br>
    Consequently, more time is dedicated to surfing the web. All in all, the experience is way more rich and positive,
    I'm mostly hanging on fascinating blogs and informative articles.<br>
    I'm also using spotify less and less, I downloaded my playlist using some rather shady app named <a
        href="https://deemix.pro/">Deemix</a>.
    I'm using <a href="https://www.slsknet.org/news/node/1">soulseek</a> for file download, also streaming some stuff on
    bandcamp and soundcloud (you gotta discover stuff somehow).<br>
    Hopefully buying from artists soon. <br>Maybe I'll start making three music mixtape a la <a
        href="https://nnnnnnnn.co">nnnnnnnnn</a>.

    I am quitting modular:
    I am not using the rack enough and vcv is loads of fun anyway (+ I get to use my own modules). So I'm selling
    everything and looking forward to buy a polybrute, back to the gool ol' keyboard.<br>
    Relaunching VCV, I got tempted to start a new module (that was predictable). The vcv SDK is back in my documents and
    <strong>Pruners.cpp</strong> has been added to source, I'll add a page in project soon to add detail about the
    process.<br>
    Pruners is gonna be something between the strymon magneto and qu-bit data bender. A sampler with additional buffer
    goodness.

        Just discovered <a href="https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes">spicetify</a>, which let you customize
        your spotify GUI !<br>
        For the past few months, I've been thinking a lot about how much I dislike Spotify's interface.<br>
        I found this today by surfing webring, on <a href="https://reduxflakes.neocities.org/work/">this young
            fellow</a> neocity.<br>
        It's a CLI app, you can install new theme by cloning <a
            href="https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes">their repo</a> <br>
        <small>Did you know that you could take a screenshot of an app on macOs using cmd+shift+4+space ?</small>

            I'm fascinated by the way a computer is navigated via a terminal.<br>
            This feeling is emphasized whenever the computer is in fact a faraway server responding to your ssh.<br>
            The sequencial <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code>, touching to see.<br>
            In a way it reminds me of "The books where you are the hero", especially when you are cheating and coming
            back to the last page cause you don't wanna lose the game.<br>
            Giving orders to the big void is somewhat scary and soothing.

                I started making my own font, a really basic one with only big rectangles.<br>
                I've always been curious of the process.<br>
                To make and export it I'm using <a href=https://glyphsapp.com>Glyph</a> in its trial version.<br>

                I've also dicovered <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono>JetBrains Mono</a> font. <br>
                I'm always on the lookout for some new ways of looking at my IDE and this is a nice one.<br>

                This composition uses pretty much the same tricks as the last one (warping in texture mode, reverb with
                loads of compression...) but in a totally different genre.<br>
                My usual smooth / chill / noisy ambient. I'm happy with the result

            sound work on the "PAYSAGE | COMPOSEE" theme.<br>
            Not having my computer when I stumbled on it, I used the devices that I keep at my parent's house. <br>
            Mostly obsolete technology that is too heavy to take from city to city.<br>
            I recorder the garden of my childhood through the open window and then slowly wear it down. <br>Recorded it
            on the reel to reel. <br>
            From the reel to reel to the cassette deck. <br>
            From the cassette deck to the guitar amp recorded through an inverted speaker.<br>
            So on.<br>
            Here the final edit using intermediate state of the signal.<br>
            The final sound is a test made on the cassette tape.<br>

            For a course on digital lutherie, I've worked on a prototype called <i>Komorebi</i> (The sun filtering
            through the leafs in japanese).<br>
            The initial tought was to highlight the warm feeling of a sun beam caressing your face when walking under
            trees.<br>
            For this I use a headset with a light captor on it, this captor send midi info (value between 0 and 127) to
            Max/Msp, which treat the data and trigger SuperCollider function accordingly via local OSC.<br>
            You can find the code <a href=https://github.com/LeNomDesFleurs/Komorebi>here (Github Link)</a>. <br>

        Frequently playing the modular with a friend of mine.<br />
        I'm learning to use the <i>Teletype</i>, here it play rotating chords on <i>qu-bit chords</i>, using the
        <code>N.C</code> operator.<br>
        <code>N.C A B C</code> <br>
        Where A is Root, B is Chord Type, C is degree.
        <br>
        Voices switch degree each chord, generating a long portamento, phasing along the way.

            I'm doing well on Sinensis VST version: I've refactored all the code in a clean way.
            implemented the odd/even high/low parameter. <br>
            Everything is working so far, but there is still a lots of works ahead. <br>
            I'm learning a lot about the juce framework and all his tools in the process.<br>
            Here is a first interface attempt to learn how to custom knobs ("juce::RotarySlider").

        Long Time no See !
        Lot of change, Wilt has been entirely re-though: no more reverb, now it's a buffer mess, reading and writing at
        a different speed.<br>
        I'm not entirely sure what is happening but it does sound nice.
        Hellebore is done, added new elements to the panel.
        All of this is out on the library.
        I'm doing a VCV pause (maybe for ever, who knows) to discover JUCE !<br>
        For now I'm really lost on which function is calling what, where are the variable, lots of obscure pointer
        trickery
        and Obviously UI is a mess.
        Seems really complicated for now, will seems really logic in few month (I hope). <br>
        I though a lot about Sinensis as a vst and a lot more idea comes to mind, I should keep the UI simple, but with
        a drawer for manual settings of band.
        New Param can be :
        <ul>
            <li>Midi input for the root frequency</li>
            <li>Band quantization with scales</li>
            <li>Manual access to each band</li>
            <li>Split Global Q and Q tone, with multiple mode (odd/even, high/low, etc..)</li>
            <li>same thing for Gain of each band instead of a simple "number of band Param"</li>
            <li>Q and gain link (in Ableton eq 8 way)</li>

        With all the git learning, shuffling code left and right, I think that I've lost Tectorum and Volubilis.<br>
        It's not that big of a fuss, Tectorum was not that a good module and Volubilis was stuck.<br>
        I will probably rebuild Volubilis from the ground up, it's what it needed anyway.<br>
        I've made a working stereo cross-feed for Hellebore, I was really surprised by the fact that it compiled and
        worked at the first try, especially cause it is based on multidimensional array (and that's a field I'm very
        prone to make error in).<br>
        Variation pan the combs 2/4/6 more and more to the opposite side. <br>
        I now have a working Msys terminal in vs code ! <br>
        Swapping between app is now a thing of the past.<br>

        Tried making a sequence with 4 square oscillators modulating the shift of Tides (thus giving some kind of
        quantization).<br>

        I've made a first attempt at a stereo reverb, for now just two separated channel each processing an input.<br>
        I created a two dimensional array containing 6 combs filter in each columns.<br>
        Using a for-each loop over a for-each loop to iterate through all the combs in parameter update and processing
        functions, columns then rows. <br>
        I'm searching ways to cross feed the two-channels, first I'll try swapping filters (and their buffer) from one
        channel to another.<br>
        I'm thinking that I should create a struct to store all the parameter and write a global function calling all
        parameter update functions.<br>
        Lets do a little refactoring and cleaning before going further.<br>
        Lots of work (and bugs) ahead.<br>

        I will probably sell my plonk, disting and rampage that I use less and less.<br>
        Here the rampage is used solely for it's comparator, creating a grainy noise to pluck the filter.<br>
        The disting is used for the noise output of it's s&h algorithm.

        I'm struggling to finish Hellebore, the nested function call makes it hard to debug.
        The reverb calls the comb filter which calls the ring buffer. Those russian dolls creates a lots of possible
        cracks for bugs to slips in.
        I've learned a bunch of things on how to declare an array of object. <br />
        It's going good but it takes all of my brain juice. <br />

        Just got a black hole dsp 2 from erica synth.
        I was doubtful about the interface (I almost never use my Disting mk4), but it seems well focused and 24
        algorithm is memorable.
        Here is the first test with the pitched delay. Tides is used as a synced lfo. Sources are Dixie, Math, Plonk and
        a plucked Morgasmatron.
