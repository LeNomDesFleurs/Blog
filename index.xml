Having a quite effervecent brain these time.<br>
Some of it take roots in my current reading :
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://stefangoldmann.bandcamp.com/merch/presets-digital-shortcuts-to-sound-book">Presets - Digital Shortcuts to Sound</a> by Stefan Goldmann~ A book about composing sounds in those time of digital efficiency, touching on the question of norm and possibility in the creative realm.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/anathem.html">Anathem</a> by Neal Stephenson</li> which is a good speculative fiction and develop a lot of playful methaphysical ideas. In a kind of Borgesian way, seeking an new way of seeing what has always been here.
</ul>
Some ideas in a chaotic space -<br><br>
<span style="transform:rotate(2deg); display:block; text-align: center;">
Does asynchronicity in dialog, by adding to the time dedicated to reflection, add to the quality the ideas ?<br>
Or the other way around, the quick exchange of ideas allow for a more thorough exploration of possibilities (including impasses, which can be as valuable)?
</span>
<br>
<span style="transform:rotate(-2deg); display:block; text-align: center;">
Will mass usage of cloud storage lead to a potential monumental loss of data ?<br>
Only the people having archived data on local drive perduring in history.
</span>
<br><br>
<span style="transform:rotate(8deg); display:block; text-align: center;">
I should try to map velocity to the delay time.
</span>
<br><br>
<span style="transform:rotate(-8deg); display:block; text-align: center;">
How to explore the narrative potential of using tools.
</span>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<span style="transform:rotate(30deg); display:block; text-align: center;">
    The eternal fight between horizontality and verticality, in all possible meanings and contexts.
</span>
<br><br><br><br>
<blockquote cite="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2024/01/11/accretive-growth-logics/">
The more I think about complex, large scale systems, the more I realize “goals” are a very unimportant feature of their behavioral profile.

</blockquote>
Does this also apply to human being, which are good exemples of complex systems ?
<br><br>Some Music :
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gEV42RKf6E">Machaut - Messe de Notre Dame</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jjuliee.bandcamp.com/album/pg-4-a-picture-of-three-hedges-through-your-window">Julie - pg​.​4 a picture of three hedges​</a></li>
</ul>

The skeumorphism <em>is often shown as</em> a bad exemple of UX, some people tend to become angry.<br>
But what about the inherent underlying concept of interacting with knobs and slider ? Is is a technical skeumorphism ? Much of was as been done is a kind of emulation. might as well go all the way.<br>
But the knob seems nonetheless to be a good info/space ratio, in a glance you can have max / min / actual value. <br>
And they are quite handy when you need to group functionality.
Things that may allow for this mere information. If you know what are the max and min of the viz, can you guess the value?

Variable font as a potentiometre.<br>
Changed the font of my IDE to <a href="https://www.recursive.design">Recursive</a>, a variable multi-axis font.

curieusement Je Retombe Sur Exactement Les Concepts Que J'Utilise Pour Réfléchir.

Je viens de découvrir que le mot aternative (in french) is about duality and binary decision, whereas, en anglais, son acception se penche sur l'ensemble de ce qui aurait pu être possible.<br><br>

Some Modification on the website : I added a <a href="index.xml">RSS feed</a> (and a short <a href="Knowledge/RSS.html">knowledge page</a> about it) and changed the main font to <a href="https://www.redaction.us">Redaction</a>
<br><br>Some Music :
