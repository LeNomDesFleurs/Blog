<h3>Why</h3>
<p>
Strolling throught the web I encountered more and more nice and slick blog of artists and developers.
<br>
People having blog often encourage other to go through the same path, such as Marc Weidenbaum in <a href="https://disquiet.com/2021/04/10/q-why-blog-a-blogs-are-great/">this article</a>.<br>
Having a blog with your projects is also a nice way to quickly show people what you do, it can also act as a kind of "business card".<br>
All my work is very niche for a lot of people, it's easier to answer the classic "what do you do for a living?" by showing stuff online.<br>
I was also searching for a way to learn a bit of HTML / CSS, and to train my english, this was a nice occasion.
<br>
<h3>Ethics</h3>

<p>
Coding HTML / CSS (<a href="/./../Knowledge/HTML~CSS.html">Link to the page with some of the stuff I learned</a>), I learned more and more about the <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">Web Obesity</a>. <br>
It just doesn't make sense to do what I do with a lot of technology.
<br>
Using HTML / CSS doesn't feel like a limit, they are just the right tools for the task.<br>
Using more tools would lead me to add unnecessary stuff (if you have a tool, you'll want to use it).
<br>
The same can be applied to medias, minimalism and dithering are integral parts of the whole esthetic.<br><br>
Here are some thought-full articles that inspired me to continue along this path :
<ul>

<li><a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/the-solar-website/"> Low Tech Magazine About Page</a> - A more technical approach</li>
<li><a href = http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com>BetterMotherFuckingWebsite</a> - ironic statement on the power of few lines of CSS</li>
<li><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">Designed To Last</a> - How to craft a long lasting web page</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    tl;dr
    <ul><li>
        Only HTML / CSS
    </li>
<li>Only default font (Arial / Times New, there are few others)</li>
<li>Compress image</li>
<li>Keep it easy to maintain</li>
<li>Self host</li></ul>
</p>
As of now I'm using two local fonts : <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrainMono</a> and <a href="https://www.redaction.us">Redaction</a>. This choice was made cause the balance <i>personal feel and reading confort / website weight</i> seems positive enough (the font files are less than 100ko). 

<h3>How it begins and expanded</h3>
It started in a very minimalistic way, the original goal was to only have the "blog" tab, all the website was supposed to be a stream of thought.<br>
But as I continue discovering new blogs, especially those from the <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com">Webring</a>, it seems like the next step was to add a project page and a knowledge basis, for my future self and for others.<br>
Formatting knowledge in a way other can understand it is very interesting. For me it's the best way to channel my craving to organize stuff, it's a never ending task, but it seems more fruitful than reorganizing my bedroom every few month.
<br>It's now a natural step in the way I learn things.<br>
<br>
I didn't really know where to add this but I try to keep all pages within two mouse clicks, I like website that are easy to wander in.<br>


<h3>Actual Hosting and future upgrades</h3>
<s>For now I am hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, using google as the domain provider.<br>
I hope I'll shift on a local server someday, it really doesn't stick with the aforementioned ethics of this website.<br>
But I gotta say Microsoft/Google bring a sort of confort, everything is easy, comitting and pushing on vscode generate the website, everything is automated.<br>
Nonetheless I want to learn some linux and server stuff, I guess it'll be the next big step.</s>
<br>
I am hosted on a Virtual Private Server, more info on <a href="/./../Knowledge/VPS.html">this knowledge page</a> for the setup.<br>
I write locally on my laptop, push on github and pull on my server through SSH.
