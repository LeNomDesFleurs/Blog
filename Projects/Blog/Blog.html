<h3>Why</h3>
<p>
Strolling throught the web I encountered more and more nice and slick blog of artists and developers.
People having blog often encourage other to go through the same path, such as Marc Weidenbaum in <a href="https://disquiet.com/2021/04/10/q-why-blog-a-blogs-are-great/">this article</a>.<br>
Having a blog with your projects is also a nice way to quickly show people what you do, it can also act as a kind of "business card".
All my work is very niche for a lot of people, it's easier to answer the classic "what do you do for a living?" by showing stuff online.<br>
I was also looking for a way to learn a bit of HTML / CSS, and to train my english, this was a nice occasion.
<br>
<h3>Ethics</h3>

<p>
Coding HTML / CSS (<a href="/./../Knowledge/HTML~CSS.html">Link to the page with some of the stuff I learned</a>), I learned more and more about the <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">Web Obesity</a>.
It doesn't make any sense to build this blog with a big stack of tech.
To me, using HTML / CSS doesn't feel like a limit, it is just the right tools for the right task.<br>
Using more tools (such as javascript) would lead me to add unnecessary stuff (if you have a tool, you'll probably want to use it).
The same reflection can be applied to assets (image, sounds), minimalism and dithering are integral parts of the whole aesthetic.
</p>
<p>
Here are some thought-full articles that inspired me to continue along this path :
<ul>
    
<li>
    <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">The Web's Grain</a> - The article where the base CSS of my blog come from
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/victor-hwang-mater-project-graphic-design-071122">It's Nice That Article</a> - A designer Point Of View</li>
<li><a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/the-solar-website/"> Low Tech Magazine About Page</a> - A more technical approach</li>
<li><a href = http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com>BetterMotherFuckingWebsite</a> - Ironic statement on the power of few lines of CSS</li>
<li><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">Designed To Last</a> - How to craft a long lasting web page</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    TL;DR
    <ul><li>
        Only HTML / CSS
    </li>
<li>Only default font (Arial / Times New, there are a few others)</li>
<li>Compress images</li>
<li>Keep it easy to maintain</li>
<li>Self host</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
<s>As of now I'm using two local fonts : <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrainMono</a> and <a href="https://www.redaction.us">Redaction</a>. This choice was made cause the balance <i>personal feel and reading confort / website weight</i> seems positive enough (the font files are less than 100ko).</s>
</p>
<p>
Haha, guess I like fonts a bit to much, here is the rundown of all the fonts on the server :
(did some clean up recently to reduce loading time and avoid font used only on some pages, but I couldn't delete the pixelated gothic it's way too cool)
</p>
<ul>
<li><s>Bodoni : A very fancy font, gives a magazine vibe </s></li>
<li><s>Bodoni Ornaments : abemojs</s></li>
<!-- <li>XITS math : <span style="font-family: Math; font-style: italic;">Handy for some equation x=y+z</span></li> -->
<li>Pixelated Gothic : <span style="font-family: Gothic;">It's barely readable but come on it's so cool</span></li>
<li>Playfair Display, the main font of the website</li>
<li><s>Redaction : It was the main font before !</s></li>
<li>JetBrainMono : <span style="font-family: JetBrain;"><code>for the code snippets</code></span></li>
<!-- <li>Analogist : <span style="font-family: Analogist;">for the code snippets</span></li> -->
<li><s>Latin Modern Roman : Another fancy title font</s></li>

<li>Lettering for the LNDF title is a tweaked version of Times New Roman</li>

</ul>
<h3>How it began and expanded</h3>
<p>
It started in a very minimalistic way, the original goal was to only have the "blog" tab, all the website was supposed to be a stream of thought.
But as I discovered new blogs, especially those from the <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com">Webring</a>, it seems like the next step was to add a project page and a knowledge base, for my future self and for others.<br>
Formatting knowledge in a way others can understand it is very interesting. For me it's the best way to channel my craving to organize stuff, 
it's a never ending task, but it seems more fruitful to organize knowledge for others, rather than reorganizing my bedroom every few months.
It is now a natural step in the way I learn things (organizing knowledge, not reorganizing my bedroom).
</p>
<p>
I didn't really know where to add this but I try to keep all pages within two mouse clicks, I like website that are easy to wander in.<br>
</p>
<p>
The flowers and leafs at the bottom of the pages are dithered photos of my herbarium. Nothing fancy, but if I have the occasion, I try to pick flowers and leafs here and there. I chose some that I like to decorate this website. 
They are not glued or scotched : I make small slits in the pages of the notebook and slide them in, you can see it especially well with the leaf in the download section. 
I like the effect it gives, using <code>.png</code>'s alpha layer to make the leaf float on the page.
</p>
<h3>Actual Hosting and future upgrades</h3>
<p>
<s>For now I am hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, using google as the domain provider.
I hope I'll shift on a local server someday, it really doesn't stick with the aforementioned ethics of this website.
But I gotta say Microsoft/Google bring a sort of confort, everything is easy, comitting and pushing on vscode generate the website, everything is automated.
Nonetheless I want to learn some linux and server stuff, I guess it'll be the next big step.</s>
</p>
<p>
I am hosted on a Virtual Private Server, more info on <a href="/./../Knowledge/VPS.html">this knowledge page</a> for the setup.
I write raw html locally on my laptop, and push updates to my server with git.
