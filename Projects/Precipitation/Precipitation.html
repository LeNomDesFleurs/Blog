    <h3>Context</h3>
<p>
Precipitation is an audiovisual installation, it is part of my studies.<br>
We're a group of 9 people.<br>
We got 2 month to develop our installation.<br>
We chose the theme ourselves : the water cycle and it's disturbance.<br>
Precipitation is a word play;<ul>
 <li>Precipitations with an 's' is rain</li> 
 <li>Precipitation without 's' is rush / haste.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Each one of us is creating a module that will be controled via OSC, with a disturbance parameter.<br>
I myself am working on plants. <br>
I took the opportunity of working on visual, it's probably the only time in my studies that I may take two whole month for this purpose.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Practical Problems</h3>
<p>
Making an installation is a lot of problem solving.<br>
Although I have one of the simplest module : a video-projector (as a refence point, a friend of mine is hanging huge cubes of ice), it do need a lot of thinking to get an optimal result.<br><br>
Some Problems :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How to have 3 axis of rotation to set it up correctly ?
    </li>
    <li>
        How to fix it to the ceiling grid ?
    </li>
    <li>Distance ?</li>
    <li>Size of image ?</li>
    <li>Kind of VP (symetric / asymetric)?</li>
    <li>Lumens ?</li>
    <li>Resolution ?</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm in luck, some VP have been dismounted of some classrooms, I get to use them.

<h3>Software Tools</h3>
<p>

I was fascinated by the <a href="/./../Knowledge/L-Systems.html">L-Systems</a> and the forms it creates.<br>
Searching for the right tools to use the plain potential of this system,
I first went toward p5.js, but <a href="/./../Knowledge/TouchDesigner.html">TouchDesigner</a> (TD) soon became an evidence.<br>
The amount of CPU ressource needed surprised me a lot, the l-sys operator is in fact 3D, and real time 3D rendering is no joke.<br>
Especially in TD, this operator in not GPU accelerated and can only use one core of the CPU.<br>
I started to think about <a href="/./../Knowledge/Shader.html">Shaders</a> and found a nice L-sys shader, but it was in no way as interesting as the 3D deformation that the SOP enabled.<br>
It's an interesting exemple of time investment, taking few days off your road to check if an alternative can save you time (and money).
One of our teacher made me consider unity, but the trees are way too realistic and organic.<br><br>
Using some 3D mangling I can transform a calm tree in a tortured texture mess.

<h3>Post Process Treatment</h3>
<p>
Feedback is a wonderfull tool to give the feeling of a sreaming ecosystem.<br>
I'm also considering the use of some dithering to add texture.<br><br>
Here is the same image as above after those processes :

<h3>Esthetic choices</h3>

<p>
    I wanted a black background to blend the border of the projected image with the wall, but it didn't worked well with the 3D shadows.<br>
    So I get back to an initial choice of black and white, to add contrast between the plants and the background.<br>
    The dither that I was sceptical about now comes in handy to add color for a better feedback. Also, the bayer dithering add a point grid to the background, which gives more material and a more uniform look to the feedback.
