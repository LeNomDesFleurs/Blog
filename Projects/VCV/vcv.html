    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p><a href="https://vcvrack.com">VCV</a> is a modular synth emulator.<br>
        It is a nice first step in developing audio effect. Only making module, you don't have to think too much about
        interfacing with the sound API and all the other complexity which comes with developing software.</p>
    <p>The interface (which can represent most of the work) are based on <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">SVGs</a>. Using a
        illustrator-like software (<a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>
        in my case) to work in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> fashion is way
        easier than the geometry based approach of JUCE (it does open more
        possibility for responsive design and evolution of knob design based on
        the parameter value). On this SVG background, you can layer the
        functional elements, input, output, switch, knob (which are also SVG
        with a rotation transform). There are some pre-existing assets for all of
        this.</p>
    <p>For the computational side, vcv gives you a simple function executing
        at each sample, accessing parameters and in/out is really simple.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://vcvrack.com/manual/PluginDevelopmentTutorial">setup
            tutorial</a> is well made, that’s dear to my heart: coming with no
        programming background, setting up an environment can be quite hard. Not
        understanding any of the weird words and encountering endless error
        messages in the command line.</p>
    <p>There are also a <em>lot</em> of examples, especially mutable
        instrument modules taught me loads of things. They are thoroughly
        commented, sometimes even with ascii schematics. For me, looking at the
        work of other is one of the most efficient ways of learning.</p>
    <p>All of this let you quickly prototype ideas.</p>
    <p>There are some problems with this platform nonetheless, open source is
        mostly one-sided, vcv get the plug-ins of many free worker while they
        keep there software closed, asking fork to close to avoid commercial
        competition. <a href="https://aria.dog/barks/why-i-will-never-create-modules-for-vcv-rack-anymore/">Aria
            Salvatrice</a> explain all of this much clearer and with a nicer looking
        website, also touching on community problem that I haven’t got to
        witness, I don’t hang much on the forum.</p>

    <h3>Noi Interfaces</h3>
    Trying to maintain a visual coherence, I set some kind of graphic charter. It can be summarize as a list of rules
    <ul>
        <li>Big Knobs</li>
        <li>Visual clue of the knob effect</li>
        <li>No label</li>
        <li>Title wrap around a param / input</li>
        <li>ASCII Pattern at the bottom that is doubled and fliped at the top</li>
        <li>The ASCII Pattern font is Eras Light 8pt</li>
        <li>Black and White only</li>
        <li>dotted line for CV / plain line for audio</li>
        <li>little symbol for normalized path</li>
        <li>The font is Eras Light 18pt</li>
        <li>Noi logo at the bottom</li>
    </ul>
    <>


        <h3>Noi Philosophy</h3>
        There are some rules I try to follow when making modules. <br>
        <li><b><i>If there is a parameter, it must be CV-able</i></b>. </li>

        To many times I've been deceived by a fun modulation that I couldn't make happen.

        <li><i>There must be an attenuverter on each CV input (except toggle)</i></li>
        - I can't emphasize how convenient it is -
        <li><i>Use less parameters</i></li>

        <h3>Noi Modules</h3>
        I started with CV modules, this let me avoid most of dsp complexities.
        <p>
            <strong>~ Dicotyledon</strong> is a logical processor, It's really easy to make, I tried to give it a little
            twist to make it interesting, normalizing the comparator to the switch.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>~ Sunflower</strong> is a bit more new, it's a circular mixer: there are 12 inputs and 1 outputs,
            leds indicates the selected input, you can blur the selection to add neighbouring input. It can be
            interesting for audio as well as CV. It works well with ambient and pendular movement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I dipped a toe into dsp with wilt.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>~ Wilt</strong> was at first a weird (in the bad sense) multi-effect, I was just trying stuff out
            and putting them in series. It evolved when I tried to implement a reverberation and found a profound well
            of granular glitch more on this in upcoming research paper.
        </p>
        <p><strong>~ Sinensis</strong> is a bank of filter. The idea comes from a course from Spitfire audio on making
            field recording musical, for this they add resonator on a note, thus adding a melodic component and making
            it playable in a sampler. Instead of one frequence, you can add harmonics to further shape the sound. At a
            point, I made an Ableton audio rack with multiple band letting me choose the tone I want. It's really not
            that practical and it's one of the first encounter with the "How do I map parameters to make this unsusable
            mess a music instrument" question.
            I ended up with sinensis, 4 parameters :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Root Frequence</li>
            <li>Global Q</li>
            <li>Number of band</li>
            <li>Frequency ratio between bands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The purpose here is, instead of pitching a sample with a resonance, to move the filter around while the
            recording is playing. A VST version will come later that also accept midi to let you play your field
            recording with a keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>~ Hellebore</strong> is following the steps of wilt, playing with reverberation concepts. The goal
            here is to find interesting ways of modulating and repitch all the buffers inside the reverberation.
            The "Variation Knob" on the left is doing a lot of stuff that are not usually associated on the same
            parameters :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bleeding of one channel to an other</li>
            <li>Disparity of buffer sizes (thus repitching)</li>
            <li>Dispartity of feedback of each delays lines</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In a similar manner than sinensis set the root and then choose the ratio, here, the buffer size set the base
            buffer size and then you set buffer size ratio.
        </p>
