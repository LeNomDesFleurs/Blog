<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
        <a href="https://juce.com">JUCE</a> is a c++ framework that makes it easy to create an audio application as a standalone and as a plugin. It has a function that deliver audio and midi buffer, UI is also simplified. So in the same fashion as VCV simplify wy work, with a bit more work, JUCE let me share my work with way more people.
        <br><br>Plugin brought a different way of thinking audio tool, in modular, people bring their own CV. Here, you gotta make them yourself. <br>
        It's an interesting thought to conceive plug-in with their own dedicated modulation, tailored for the use. 
        <br><br>
        As a template I use this <a href="https://github.com/tomoyanonymous/juce_cmake_vscode_example/tree/main">Github Repo</a>. Which is a combination of cmake, lldb, clang++, vscode, and ableton to send sound to the plug-in and test it.

<h3>NOI PLUGINS</h3>
For now noi plugins are on the back burner, but they'll be back in a few month when I'll have a bit more time<br><br>
<h3>Sinensis</h3>
After a discussion with a friend of mine operating <a href="https://www.hal-audio.com">HAL audio</a> I've decided to add modes to sinensis.<br>
There is now multiple way of setting the ratio between the bands, 
before, there was a knob to set the ratio between each band frequency.<br>
Two new mode are now added:<ul>
    <li>A poly midi mode where each band as its own amplitude envelope </li>
    
</ul>
