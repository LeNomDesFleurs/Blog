<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
        <a href="https://juce.com">JUCE</a> is a c++ framework that makes it easy to create an audio application as a standalone and as a plugin. 
        It has a function that deliver audio and midi buffer, UI is also simplified. So in the same fashion as VCV simplify my work, with a bit more work, JUCE let me share my work with way more people.
        <br><br>Plugin brought a different way of thinking audio tool, in modular, people bring their own CV. Here, you gotta make them yourself. <br>
        It's an interesting thought to conceive plug-in with their own dedicated modulation, tailored for the use. 
        <br><br>
        As a template I use this <a href="https://github.com/tomoyanonymous/juce_cmake_vscode_example/tree/main">Github Repo</a>. Which is a combination of cmake, lldb, clang++, vscode, and ableton to send sound to the plug-in and test it.<br>
        <br>You can find some snippet of code and tips on <a href="../../Knowledge/JUCE.html">this Knowledge page</a>.

<h3>NOI PLUGINS</h3>
NOI Plug-ins are (for now), adaptation of the NOI VCV-Rack Modules.<br>
With them, I aim to experiment on interfaces, getting rid of skeuomorphism and try more experimental stuff.

<h3>Sinensis</h3>

<br><br>
Sinensis is a bunch of bandpass filters. Inspired by modular such as Tides and Just Friends, you modulate their relation instead of their absolute frequencies.<br>
You set the root frequency (either by hand with a tune widget, or with the MIDI input).<br>
You then set the ratio between each band frequence and the gain of each band following simple functions.
I contrained myself to avoid knob, sliders, drop-down menus and numeric values. 
Using colors and their evolution to inform the user. 
The goal being to show the state of the system, not to visualize each of its parameters.<br> 
In contrast with this unusual method, I chose to make a very clear and structured UI, big fonctionality blocks
I would like to have some people to test it whitout explanation. I've had some fonctional feedback, but not much on the UI.
<br>Taking feedback was interesting, how do I add people expectation while still following my idea, should I add it altogether ?
<br>Exemple : the note lock system.
Usually, this kind of things is implemented with a drop-down menu containing all the possible musical scale. Here I choosed to use twelve buttons. 
Inconvenient : people need to know their scales. In a way, I out-source scale selection to the users knowledge / internet.
But allowing a more modular system also mean more manipulation, you can automate note lock for each note, or choose only three notes if you need it.<br>
Harmonics being not to much of my concern, I find this to be a good balance : people who want to experiment have access to fondamental tool (12TET fondamental, which is not very fondamental) and hands-on manipulation, people who just want to be in tune can dial in their scale.
