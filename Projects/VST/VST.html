<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
        <a href="https://juce.com">JUCE</a> is a c++ framework that makes it easy to create an audio application as a standalone and as a plugin. 
        It has a function that deliver audio and midi buffer, UI is also simplified. So in the same fashion as VCV simplify my work, with a bit more work, JUCE let me share my work with way more people.
        <br><br>Plugin brought a different way of thinking audio tool, in modular, people bring their own CV. Here, you gotta make them yourself. <br>
        It's an interesting thought to conceive plug-in with their own dedicated modulation, tailored for the use. 
        <br><br>
        As a template I use this <a href="https://github.com/tomoyanonymous/juce_cmake_vscode_example/tree/main">Github Repo</a>. Which is a combination of cmake, lldb, clang++, vscode, and ableton to send sound to the plug-in and test it.<br>
        <br>You can find some snippet of code and tips on <a href="../../Knowledge/JUCE.html">this Knowledge page</a>.

<h3>NOI PLUGINS</h3>
NOI Plug-ins are (for now), adaptation of the NOI VCV-Rack Modules.<br>
With them, I aim to experiment on interfaces, getting rid of skeuomorphism and try more experimental stuff.
<br><br>
<h3>Sinensis</h3>
Sinensis is a bunch of bandpass filters. Inspired by modular such as Tides and Just Friends, you modulate their relation instead of their absolute frequencies.<br>
You set the root frequency (either by hand with a tune widget, or with the MIDI input).<br>
You then set the ratio between each band frequence and the gain of each band following simple functions.
